For several years the leaders of recruitment were brought to manage manually the entire recruitment process which consumes a lot of time and energy charge. It appears an awareness of the need to simplify this process in order to gain time and minimize the risk of errors.

This management requires the use of efficient technologies and to be non-greedy in memory.

The project that we worked on consisted of the development and implementation of a recruitment management management system whatsoever the Front Office or the Back Office for a subsidiary of a European leader in engineering and technology consulting,  using PHP5 with Zend Framework, the CMF Centurion, JQuery, and others.

Thus, after several meetings with human resource managers of the company a detailed functional specifications document has been defined, we began a thorough study of agile methods "scrum" and " Kanban "by making a comparative study of the two for moving to the design and development of the different modules of the project.
