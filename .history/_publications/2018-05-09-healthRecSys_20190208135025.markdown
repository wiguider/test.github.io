The support of a qualified coach is crucial to keep the motivation of
sportspeople high and help them pursuing an active lifestyle. In this
paper, we discuss the scenario in which a coach follows sportspeople
remotely by means of an eHealth platform, named u4fit. Having
to deal with several users at the same time, with no direct human
contact, means that it is hard for coaches to quickly spot who,
among the people she follows, needs a more timely support. To this
end, in this paper we present an automated approach that analyzes
the adherence of sportspeople to their planned workout routines.
The approach is able to suggest to the coach the sportspeople who
need earlier support due to a poor performance. Experiments on
real data, evaluated through classic accuracy metrics, show the
effectiveness of our approach.
