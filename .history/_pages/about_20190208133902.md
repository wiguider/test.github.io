I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it), supervised by [Salvatore Mario Carta](http://people.unica.it/salvatoremariocarta/).

My Ph.D. is supported by a grant from the **National Operational Programme ESF-ERDF â€œResearch and Innovation" 2014-2020**, promoted by the **Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research**.

I am interested in Recommender systems, eHealth and IoT.

I have worked in different companies as a Software Engineer or as a Big Data/Machine Learning Engineer, but I am interested in doing a research career.

I was also teaching Object-Oriented Programming and JAVA at the [Mohammed V University](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5r/).

I obtained a Master's degree in Software Quality at [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University](http://www.usmba.ac.ma) of Fez in Morocco and a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the [Mohammed V University](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5r/) of Rabat.
