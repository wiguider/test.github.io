I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it), advised by Prof. [Salvatore Mario Carta](http://people.unica.it/salvatoremariocarta/) and Dr. [Ludovico Boratto](https://www.ludovicoboratto.com/).  During my Ph.D., I am collaborating with the Data Science and Big Data Analytics research group at [Eurecat – Technology Centre of Catalonia](https://eurecat.org/en/) (Spain), [Abinsula](https://www.abinsula.com/en/) (Italy), and [U4FIT](https://www.u4fit.com/) (Italy).

My Ph.D. is supported by a grant from the **National Operational Programme ESF-ERDF “Research and Innovation" 2014-2020**, promoted by the **Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research**.

My current research interests focus on Algorithmic Fairness, Recommender Systems, and User Modeling.

Besides research work, I am also contributing to the Project Management and Software Development of the [U4FIT](https://www.u4fit.com/) platform.

Prior to starting the Ph.D., I was Data Scientist at [theShukran](http://www.theshukran.com/) (Italy). Earlier, I was a Software Engineer at [Softfobia](https://www.softfobia.com/) (Italy). I have also held Scrum Master and Software Engineering positions at [B3G Technologies](http://www.b3gtech.com/) (Morocco), [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/en) (Morocco), and [ALTEN](https://www.alten.com/) (Morocco).

My prior work experience also includes teaching Object-Oriented Programming at [Mohammed V University](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5r/).

Before moving to Italy, I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at [Mohammed V University](http://www.um5.ac.ma/um5r/) of Rabat and Master’s degree in Software Quality at [Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University](http://www.usmba.ac.ma) of Fez. I am fluent in Arabic, Darija, English, French, and Italian, and have a steadily improving command of Spanish.
